Here's what Claude.ai has to say about the user settings file:

jsonCopy"security.allowedUNCHosts": ["wsl.localhost"]

  This allows VS Code to access network paths from WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) safely.

jsonCopy"security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles": "open"

  Tells VS Code to open files from untrusted sources without prompting you. A bit less secure but more convenient.

jsonCopy"cSpell.userWords": ["ASSRT", "mdtoc"]

  These are custom words you've added to the spell checker dictionary to prevent it from flagging them as misspellings.

jsonCopy"editor.minimap.enabled": false

  Turns off that tiny code preview on the right side of the editor.

jsonCopy"cSpell.enabledFileTypes": {"cpp": true}

  Enables spell checking specifically for C++ files.

jsonCopy"workbench.colorTheme": "Default Light Modern"

  Sets your color scheme to the light theme.

jsonCopy"vim.surround": false

  Disables Vim's surround feature (the ability to wrap text in parentheses, quotes, etc.).

jsonCopy"vim.highlightedyank.duration": 100

  When you yank (copy) text in Vim mode, it highlights it briefly - this sets that highlight to last 100ms.

jsonCopy"workbench.settings.applyToAllProfiles": [...]

  Makes certain settings (the yankduration and cursor surrounding lines) apply across all your VS Code profiles.

jsonCopy"editor.cursorSurroundingLines": 0
"editor.stickyScroll.scrollWithEditor": false
"workbench.tree.enableStickyScroll": false
"terminal.integrated.stickyScroll.maxLineCount": 1
"editor.stickyScroll.enabled": false
"editor.stickyScroll.maxLineCount": 1

  This whole block is about scroll behavior - you've basically turned off most of the "sticky" scrolling features that keep certain elements visible while scrolling.

jsonCopy"editor.occurrencesHighlight": "off"

  Disables automatic highlighting of other occurrences when you select a word.

  It looks like you prefer a clean, minimal interface without too many visual bells and whistles!
